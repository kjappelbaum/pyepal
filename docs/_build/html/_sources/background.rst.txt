Background
===========

This package implements the `Îµ-PAL algorithm from Zuluaga et al. <>` in an object oriented interface for finding the Pareto efficient points in any number of dimensions with any model that can output a standard deviation and a mean.

We make sure that the sampling is scale invariant and that the algorithm can deal with positive and negative objective values.

In our own work, we used this algorithm for materials discovery.
