"""Use PAL with the neural tangent library.
This allows to perform
1. Exact Bayesian inference (NNGP)
2. Inference using gradient descent with MSE loss (NTK)
3. Inference using an ensemble of finite-width neural networks

Note that the neural tangent code usually assumes mean-zero Gaussians

        Args:
            X_design (np.array): Design space (feature matrix)
            models (Sequence[NT_TUPLE]): You need to provide a sequence of
                namedtuples NT_TUPLE (`pyepal.models.nt_stax.NT_TUPLE`).
                The elements of this tuple are the `apply_fn`, `init_fn`,
                `kernel_fn` and `predict_fn` (for latter you can typically
                provide `None`)
            ndim (int): Number of objectives
            epsilon (Union[list, float], optional): Epsilon hyperparameter.
                Defaults to 0.01.
            delta (float, optional): Delta hyperparameter. Defaults to 0.05.
            beta_scale (float, optional): Scaling parameter for beta.
                If not equal to 1, the theoretical guarantees do not necessarily hold.
                Also note that the parametrization depends on the kernel type.
                Defaults to 1/9.
            goals (List[str], optional): If a list, provide "min" for every objective
                that shall be minimized and "max" for every objective
                that shall be maximized. Defaults to None, which means
                that the code maximizes all objectives.
            coef_var_threshold (float, optional): Use only points with
                a coefficient of variation below this threshold
                in the classification step. Defaults to 3.
            kernel (str, optional): The kernel type you want to use ('nngp' or 'ntk').
